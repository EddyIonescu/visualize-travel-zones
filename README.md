# visualize-travel-zones
Visualize trips from CSV on map image

Used to visualize trips for an assignment in PLAN-478 at the University of Waterloo.

Although many things are hardcoded, this notebook can be easily modified to visualize travel-zone trip origin-destination charts onto a diagram or an image of a map.
